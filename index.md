**## UPDATES:**

On 31.3.2017

Dear students, some final considerations before the deadline for the final PDF
uploaded on the system:
- Always to put your Google Doc with comments opened,it's impossible for us to comment if you have read only.
- Nevertheless the status of the project, upload the doc to the system, we can not review now projects outside the Google GSoC system.
- Have you prepared and uploaded the Proof of Enrollment? Some of you still have doubts about this, even non universitary students presenting projects.

Thank you for the many proposals received and good luck to everybody!

The mentor and admin team

On 26.3.2017

We've been reviewing the sample codes lots of you have sent, thank you!
We can say that most of you are having trouble with the code, mostly for not issuing any kind of **tests** and some for other kind of little and not little problems, specially in the running median exercise.

As we told you we're taking notes for our internal review process, but at this time **you have to go now** to the https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com page, make an account and upload your project. After this we'll contact the best project proposals with the best code abilities. A mentor will exchange some emails with you and if you are doing well we will set up a hangout.

On 10.3.2017:

We've received a lot of your proposed solutions for our initial test, and we've been looking at the source and noted in our internal scoring system, that will help on your real application to the project if you finally present.
As said in our last update we'll be contacting for a hangout only to the good coders, giving clues to all of you have sending code of how to act, but this process can be from now till april due to lots of requests.

The application runs from March 20, 2017  to April 3, 2017, so stay tunned to https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ and in those days apply to the program in the Google control system.

On 5.3.2017:

Thank you for the expressed interest on our project, still ahead of the application window we have received almost a hundred inquiries.
For all of you that want to apply to our project, we have created a initial test.
You will have to solve two exercises to show up your coding abilities.

Find the test in this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t0i3wShrLADQGi3JtePmKksoWzvHvLJjKF2H9CwDGlI/edit?usp=sharing).

You'll need to publish your code on a github repo and send the link back to us through our contact email.

We'll be reviewing all applications and we'll be interviewing by hangout the developers we think have done a great code.

**PLEASE: be polite, and do not copy the code**

On 1.3.2017:

We are again on the Google Summer of Code.
Students can start to review our ideas page below and send emails to
[physicalwebproject@gmail.com](mailto://physicalwebproject@gmail.com) with possible proposals and questions.
Our mentor team will be answering your queries ASAP.
We recommend to all students to look carefully at the [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) page
and be ready for the march 20th project registering process.

We look forward for your proposals. :)

On 19.1.2016:

Dear students from around the world.

The Physical Web GSoC mentor team has presented again the project with the support of Google Chrome team to the GSoC. Let’s wait for news to start the development of this year projects.

### What is the Physical Web and the Physical Web Project?

The Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core superpower of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away. 

The number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn't realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn't about replacing native apps: it's about enabling interaction when native apps just aren't practical.

The Physical Web Project is the Google Summer of Code proposal for university students interested in developing applications around that technology. The Physical Web Project, while making use of [Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/) software, does not develop the Physical Web code-base itself. Physical Web is an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible. Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.


### What kinds of skills or experience should you bring?

* Programming in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS3 or other languages.
* Experience with Web Bluetooth.
* Experience with Mobile environment, including Android.
* Experience with Wireless development, including Bluetooth Low Energy.
* Experience in small PC like systems such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Beagle Board.
* Technical experience with other Internet of Things systems.

### Suggested GSoC 2017 Project Ideas

We have plenty of great things you could work on, here are some briefly described and to be developed, but first take a look at the [ideas page](http://google.github.io/physical-web/examples) from the main web site. 
And also remember that you can propose us with your ideas.

* JSON AutoDescriptive AutoDiscover Objects  

*Idea*: Hundreds of objects surround us daily in everyday environments. The idea is to be able to label the hundreds of objects that are around us and to have a control of all their relationships. For example, in a toy room, we can label the toys with a Physical Web. Then, using an application, we can know their characteristics, their information and their relationships with other toys in the own environment, such as a remote car with its control. We could generate an specific format, using the JSON standard to label the objects and create their relationships.  
To be coded: The application has to deal with generating a backend to manage the objects and a web application to query the information about this near objects.

*Skills needed*: Programming in JavaScript (Node.js and Angular.js), HTML5 and CSS3. Experience with Wireless development, including Bluetooth Low Energy.

* PW Museum Backend

*Idea*: To push the use of Physical Web uses in museums, exhibitions and similar use cases, the idea is to develop a simple CMS that manages basic types of contents and info cards,  linking them to a PW beacon. Minimal contents type are text, images, audio and video. A map handling solution has to be included, to allocate and control the beacons deployed. Analytics will be welcome. The system has to handle the proximity to the beacon and refresh to the nearer contents with accuracy and thinking about the user behaviour.
To reach the push goal this CMS has to be implemented using free services, we think of a Android Application as the core manager and CMS and Google Drive, Firebase (Spark) or similar free systems as database.

*Skills needed*: Android, Firebase, Google Drive API.

* Hospital Routing

*Idea*: When going to a hospital to visit a relative or a friend we usually get lost as all the corridors look the same, sometimes we do not even know it which floor we are! The main idea here is, using PW beacons, develop a web or mobile app that tells us where we are. In that map we will see several switched off points and a bright one, telling us our current position. When we keep walking, we need to know to which beacon we are approaching and, when we are near it, refresh the layout to update the user’s position. It is important to keep control of the BT signal to do so and update the UI in the most user friendly way possible.

*Skills needed*: Programming in JavaScript (Node.js and Angular.js), HTML5 and CSS3. Experience with Wireless development, including Bluetooth Low Energy.

* Assistive Scanner

*Idea*: Create a new PW scanner for the blind that looks for a unique marker (e.g. URL param &audio) that marks the web page as containing audio. The scanner loads the page, looking for JSON+LD which points to the audio. As user has this new scanner open, it reads aloud what it finds. Existing users can use exactly the same beacons (and standard PW scanner) to look at typical HTML pages.

*Skills needed*: Web Languages.

* Smartphone Auto Setting  

*Idea*: Useful to autoset a preselected settings on the phone. E.g. When a user arrives to a place, its smartphone reads a particular beacon and it starts the silent mode.  
To be coded: android app that automatically starts preselected settings on the phone

*Skills needed*: Android, Firebase.

* Guide me for blind people  

*Idea*: For people with visual problems, some beacons in the path could help to provide further information about the place or to check if it is the correct destination, it can help to ensure that the beacon provides extra information about the place until the next beacon (if there are obstacles, stairs, wide corridor, etc.)  
To be coded: Android app that detects different physical web beacons, check the distance and gives information via voice.

*Skills needed*: nodeJS, angularJS, bootstrap, html

* Local Air & Weather Info  

*Idea*: To check weather information or other open data information, when a user arrives to a place, the beacon can tell, temperature, level of air pollution, etc.  
To be coded: Android app that check a physical web beacon and gives relevant open data information with push notifications. Backend to set locations beacons and information.  

*Skills needed*:  nodeJS, angularJS, bootstrap, html

* Interactive License Plate for Drones  

*Idea*: Drones are gonna be everywhere soon moving goods, medicines, and many more things. As we have the right to know what’s going on over our heads, the idea is that every drone has a PW beacon pointing to an url with information about his trip. This web page has to be dynamically generated each time the drone departs from a place to another, and if it’s in the range of the BLE radio, the user will have different informations about the drone and his trip or a fixed virtual license plate.  
To be coded: The application has to deal with generating a backend for different users to register his drones, and have a link to a multi drone system. Also the front end consisting on a mobile site done in Polymer, Html5, or similar modern web languages with Material Design aspect.  

*Skills needed*: Python.  

### Open ideas

We want students proposal based on some technologies that will be a hit this 2017.

* [Web Bluetooth](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5264933985976320),
which is about to ship in Chrome 56 in February 2017. 
[Here](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5264933985976320) you can find the description of the web bluetooth API.
* [Angular.io](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/the-web-bluetooth-module-for-angular-9336c9535d04#.gtzjr05kb),
Also we would like to see student proposal that uses Angular as the framework for the GUI.
[Here](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/the-web-bluetooth-module-for-angular-9336c9535d04#.gtzjr05kb) you can find an idea
* [RFDuino](https://gist.github.com/scottjenson/31e8f82cc163d34ffac176023bf1f18d),
And last but never least IoT based projects like this [RFDuino](https://gist.github.com/scottjenson/31e8f82cc163d34ffac176023bf1f18d), and arduino sketch that replies to a web bluetooth request

Remember that the ideas you proposed us have to be enough consistent for a 3+ months of development, as the GSoC agenda marks.

### GSoC 2016 Projects Developed

* [Project IBRI Drone](https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/IBRI_Drone)

![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wubOLhH-CR0/WICaWR8FGCI/AAAAAAAEsxg/BQtlxlleYxoGXAlKZfd2dfFM3NkeO38FACLcB/s1600/IBRIlogo150.png)

*Student*: Moisés Lodeiro Santiago

IBRI project developed a system that will allow any person going to a walk or a trek in the mountains or around to have their own Physical Web beacon just in case an emergency happens. The IBRI project register the beacons on a database with data from the person, and a unique identifier recorded on the beacon. If the person gets lost in the mountains or wherever, a fleet of drones will look around the area to find the beacon signal, and giving this information to emergency systems.

* [Project BYOP](https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/Liquid-Galaxy-POIs-Controller/blob/master/GSOC16.md)

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HXo_rwK4HONJDfYw73IF1ISRmqC1hrNFxsJa8_X040E6i5VF1-7efUFRVfTwspSc53a2NA=s147)

*Student*: Iván Josa

Liquid Galaxy needed a bluetooth scanner which will interact with Physical Web (PW) Beacon. Once the scanner has found this PW beacon it will interact with the Liquid Galaxy (LG) to make it know there is someone who wants to deploy its POIs, so the LG will wait for confirmation. This LG App has an easy interface that will have a connect button, a confirmation one (for security reason). Another button was added for a restoration of the previous POIs after a visit.  

**More info**: [Bring Your Own Pois Web](https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/Liquid-Galaxy-POIs-Controller/blob/master/GSOC16.md)

* [Project Smart Coffee Machine with proximity pairing](https://github.com/alexisduque/pw-coffee-machine)

*Student*: Alexis Duque

The primary goal is to demonstrate how fun can be Physical Web and how it can make our life better, making a Physical Web enabled smart coffee machine. This coffee machine can guess your coffee preferences and brew for you a coffee as soon as you are in proximity, without you have to do anything, thanks to your personal Physical Web beacon. It can be an own machine, at home, at work, or in any public place, like a bar or a restaurant.
